;;; History:
;;
;; 0.1 - Initial version
;; 0.2 - Fixed prompting with hotsynching. Thanks to Liam M. Healy for the better code!
;; 0.3 - Changed reliance on "makedoc" as the TXT to Palm DOC convertor to "txt2pdbdoc"
;;
;;; Notes:
;;
;; This code is basically "borrowed" from Andrew J Cosgriff pilot-memo.el. This can be found here
;; http://polydistortion.net/sw/emacs-lisp/ 
;;
;; My pilot-doc.el complements Andrew's work 
;;
;; Usage : M-x save-buffer-to-pilotdoc
;;
;; It converts then loads up the current buffer to the Palm in the 'doc' format.
;;
;; You will also need a copy of 'txt2pdbdoc' which can be found at
;; http://homepage.mac.com/pauljlucas/software.html
;;
;; You will also need the `pilot-link' software installed, as this code simply
;; runs the external `pilot-xfer' program to do all the hard work.
;;
;; `pilot-link' source can be found at http://pilot-link.org
;; or, if you're running one of the more popular Linux distributions, there may be an installable
;; package available as part of the distribution....
